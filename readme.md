# React Examples

Just few React components and hooks. I created them to test basic concepts of React and make tutorial for beginners.

### Quick start:

1. Download this folder and make it your local repo.

2. Use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies listed in package.json.

3. Use my ESLint config (airbnb) or delete it and create new one.

4. You are ready to go.

5. To start webpack-dev-server, use ```npm run start```
To bundle, minify and uglify all js/jsx and css code, use ```npm run build```
